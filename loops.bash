## THE CHALLENGE

#   Create a file named loops.bash.

#   The first two positional parameters which will be passed into your script
#   are the limits. You should write all even numbers in the range between the
#   first and second positional parameters.

#   Example:

#      ./loops.bash 10 17

#   Output:

#      10
#      12
#      14
#      16

#   Use for, while or until loops to solve this problem.
